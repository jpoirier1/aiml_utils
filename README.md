### A repository to keep track of all the latest scripts and utilities I am working on to try and help me in my projects and research.

I will be periodically updating this but will mostly just have it as a place to dump all my current work and checkpoint my progress.



### Current Scripts:
   1. Counting photos and categories in a dataset
   2. Checking for duplicate images
   3. Transforming tagging between PascalVOC and Yolo
   4. Converting images between jpg and png
